<h3>EP240414a: A Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Weakened by an Extended Circumstellar Material</h3>
<h6> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250316243H/abstract">Hamidani et al. 2024b</a> </h6>

EP240414a was a very mysterious explosion discovered by Einstein Probe mission, due to its unique features compared to other gamma-ra burts. We found that all the unique features of EP240414a could be explained by by a jet weakned a CSM.
