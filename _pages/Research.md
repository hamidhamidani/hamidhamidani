My research focuses on stellar cataclysmic events such as neutron star mergers and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In particular, I study the dynamics of astrophysical jets launched by these explosive phenomena and their electromagnetic counterparts. Below is a summary of selected projects.

### An Explanation for the Mysterious Explosion *EP240414a*  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250316243H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024b</a>

*EP240414a* is a unique explosion discovered by the Einstein Probe mission, displaying features that deviate from standard GRBs. In this work, I proposed that these peculiarities can be naturally explained by a jet that was significantly weakened by interaction with extended circumstellar material (CSM).

### GRB Jet Propagation in Circumstellar Material — Solved Analytically  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250316242H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024a</a>

This work presents a general analytic model for GRB jet propagation through extended CSM. I explored how the jet's ability to break out—and the nature of the resulting transient—depend on CSM properties, identifying conditions for successful or choked jets and linking to the diversity of observed transients.

### GRB 211211A: Engine-powered vs. r-process-powered Kilonova  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971L..30H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024</a>

We argue that the blue emission in GRB 211211A cannot be explained by r-process heating alone. Instead, our model suggests that late-time energy injection from a central engine offers a more consistent explanation of its properties.

### Late Engine Activity and Its Cocoon  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...963..137H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024</a>

This work investigates how prolonged engine activity in neutron star mergers can inflate a cocoon that produces blue kilonova-like emission. We provide predictions for associated X-ray signals and suggest this may explain the early light in GW170817.

### Cocoon Cooling Emission from BNS Mergers  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.4841H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani & Ioka 2023</a>

We modeled the cooling emission from post-breakout cocoons in neutron star mergers, showing they can generate bright, short-lived blue/UV transients—relevant for future multi-messenger detections.

### Cocoon Breakout and Escape  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.1111H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani & Ioka 2023</a>

This study investigated the conditions under which a cocoon can break out and escape from merger ejecta, producing fast-moving blue emission. The results constrain the viewing angle and energetics of observed transients.

### Jet Propagation in Expanding Media  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500..627H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani & Ioka 2021</a>

This work analyzed how GRB jets behave when propagating through expanding ejecta. We derived new criteria for breakout success and found that such environments can suppress jet luminosity and delay emission.

### Ideal Engine Durations for GRB Jet Launch  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.469.2361H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2017</a>

We identified the optimal timescale for engine activity to ensure the successful launch of jets in collapsars. Short engines fail to penetrate the star; overly long engines are inefficient. The results have implications for LGRB central engine modeling.
